## Ingredients

### Batter

- 2 c. white all-purpose flour (256g, 9oz)
- 1/2 tsp. baking soda
- 2 tsp. baking powder
- 1/4 tsp. salt
- 1 tsp. ground cinnamon
- 1/4 c. chopped walnuts (optional; 50g dry weight)
- 1 tbsp. shredded or flaked (sweetened) coconut (optional)


- 1/2 c. butter (alt: 1 c. shortening + 6 tbsp. water)
- 1/2 c. white sugar (100g, 3.55oz)
- 1/4 c. packed brown sugar (55g, 1.9oz)
- 1/4 tsp. vanilla extract
- 1 egg


- 1 to 1.5 c. banana (typically: 2 or 3 bananas)
- 1/3 c. buttermilk (alt: 1 tbsp. cream + 1/4 c. milk + 1 tsp. lemon juice)
- 1 tbsp. sour cream (optional)

### Topping

- 1/2 tsp. ground cinnamon
- 2 tbsp. white sugar

## Preparation

- Sift flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon and set aside.

    After sifting, mix in walnuts and coconut with dry ingredients if including
    them in the recipe.

- Combine cinnamon and sugar for topping and set aside.

- Mash banana thoroughly with buttermilk (and sour cream) and set aside.
  If using 3 bananas, consider adding 1 to 2 tbsp. additional milk.

- Cream butter and sugar well, then beat in egg and vanilla extract.

- Add flour and banana alternately into the creamed butter, mix until smooth.

## Assembly & Baking

- Pour batter into a (greased) 9×5 loaf pan and level.
- Sprinkle topping evenly over the batter.
- Bake 350°F 45–60 min.

## Notes

- When adding coconut, chop the coconut along with the walnuts to avoid long
  "threads" of coconut in the bread. It's fine either way, but the texture is
  better with small pieces.
  
- 2 or 3 typical bananas is fine for a single loaf; I prefer the texture with 3.
  At 4 or more, you should split the recipe.

- **Holiday variant:** Replace half or more of the buttermilk with egg nog, and
  reduce sugar by 1 tbsp.
