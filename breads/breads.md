# Bread Recipes

TODO(creachadair): Convert volume measures to mass, fix formatting.

## Theoretical considerations

For 3 1/2 c. of flour, a plain white bread should have 1 1/2 c. of liquid.  For a drier dough (suitable for bagels, pretzels, etc.), reduce the quantity to 1 1/4 c. of liquid.  For a stickier dough, e.g. baguette, increase to 1 2/3 c. It is almost always worth measuring, but bear in mind that the ability of flour to absorb liquid will vary depending upon the uniformity of the flour, and the ambient humidity.  Most commercial all-purpose and unbleached bread flours include stabilizers, which make this less important, but when you are working with less processed flours, or with whole-grain flours, you must take this into consideration carefully.

When working with whole-wheat flour, keep in mind that the extra bran from the exterior of the kernel will inhibit gluten development and yeast growth, so whole-grain breads should include some food for the yeast (e.g., sugar, honey, etc.).  Maple syrup can be effective, but its potency is variable, and the flavour is very pronounced, so be careful not to use too much.  Honey imparts the best flavour, but if you cannot use honey for some reason (for instance, if you are making vegan bread), you should fall back on ordinary granulated sugars.  No more than a tablespoon of sweetener should be required for a 3 1/2 c. recipe (but more is fine).

Salt strengthens the crumb, but inhibits yeast growth, so try not to exceed 1 1/2 t. of salt for a 3 1/2 c. recipe (or the equivalent ratio).  Salt is not strictly necessary with sufficiently hard wheat, but it makes the dough easier to work with, and helps alleviate the potential for over-kneading.

When baking, use lower temperatures (~ 380°F) and longer baking times for a thicker and chewier crust and crumb.  A higher temperature results in a lighter crumb, and crispier crust.  This can also be modulated by the addition of steam into the oven (either using a pan of water, or a spray bottle—I like the latter best).

When using sourdough, mix the starter so that it is equal parts flour and water.  Then, for each measure of starter that you use, subtract one-half a measure of flour and one-half a measure of water from the starting requirements of the recipe.  This amount may require adjustment, but it has been my experience that sourdough is a bit touchy to get working correctly, and you should not over-estimate its strength (i.e., the vigour with which it grows).

### Plain White Bread

- 4 t. yeast
- 2 2/3 c. water
- 7 c. flour
- 1 T. salt

Dissolve yeast in 1 1/3 c. hot water for 5-6 minutes; sponge in flour for about 20 minutes.

Any seeds or oil infusions can be kneaded in after the dough has been formed, while it is being kneaded.

Rise 1.5-2 hours covered. Keep dough moist to prevent crusting at this stage.

Deflate and rise again 1 hr. (optional, but desirable)

Deflate again, split and shape loaves.  Recommend oval loaves.

Proof 50-60 min., bake at 400°F for 45-50 min. with steam.

Notes and additions:
- Infuse 1/2 t. dried dill in 1 T. oil, and knead into dough, for a tasty dill bread.
  Be careful not to add too much dill, as the flavour can become overpowering.
- Add 1–2 tsp. of sesame seeds during kneading for a good flavour.
- A salt wash over the crust enhances the flavour and crispness of the crust.
- Generally speaking, replacing 2–4 T. of water with oil softens the crumb, and makes
  it more flexible and resilient.  This also appears to help the bread keep longer.

### Milk Bread

- 2 t. yeast
- 1 t. sugar
- 1 1/4 c. warm milk
- 3 1/2 c. flour
- 1 1/2 t. salt

Dissolve yeast with sugar in 1/2 c. milk. Mix into flour, no sponge.

Rise twice, 45 min. each; proof 60 min.

Bake at 400°F for 45 min.

Optionally:  An egg or honey glaze prior to baking is tasty.

### Flat Bread (Piadina)

- 2 t. yeast
- 4 T. water
- 3 1/2 c. flour
- 2 t. salt
- 1 T. olive oil
- 1 c. carbonated water

Dissolve yeast in 4 T. water.

Mix flour and salt. Combine with yeast, oil, and 2/3 c. carbonated water.

Knead to a firm, elastic dough, adding reserved water as needed.

Rise 90 min., divide into eighths, rest 10 min.

Roll into rounds (rest again if resistant)

Cook on heavy griddle, medium heat, very hot, until golden brown.

Prick to deflate bubbles, turn frequently (~5-6 min. each).

### Whole Wheat Bread

- 2 t.		yeast
- 1 1/3 c.	water*
- 1 1/2 T.	honey or sugar
- 2 T.		olive oil
- 1 t.		salt
- 3 c.		whole-wheat flour

Dissolve yeast in 1 c. water, dissolve honey or sugar in remaining water, and mix with yoghurt and oil.  Sponge yeast in flour for 15–20 min., then combine to make dough.  Rise 1.5–2 hours, deflate and rise again 1 hour.  Proof 1 hour, and bake 50 min. at 375°F.

Note: The extra bran in whole wheat flour inhibits rising, so some sugar is helpful in order to stimulate the yeast.  You should also allow longer rising times, and keep the dough moist while it rises.  Cutting the whole-wheat flour with white flour helps offset this trouble.

### Naan

- 2 t. yeast
- 1 c. milk
- 3 1/2 c. flour
- 1 1/2 t. salt
- 1 t. sugar
- 3 T. yoghurt
- 2 T. ghee or melted unsalted butter

Dissolve yeast in 1/2 c. milk, combine all at once. Knead elastic.

Rise 3-4 hours, deflate, divide, and rest 10 min.  Shape into flat teardrop loaves.

Preheat baking sheet 2 min.

Grill each 2-3 min. under flames in pairs (should yield ~4 breads)

### Poori

- 1/2 c. white flour (sifted)
- 1/2 c. wheat flour
- 1/4 t. salt
- 1/2 c. water
- 1 T. oil

Combine flour, salt, sugar; mix in yeast and half remaining water to make a firm, moist dough.

Add remaining water as needed to get a firm, stiff dough; knead 10 min., kneading in extra flour as required.

Rise 1 hr. in an oiled bowl. Deflate, divide into 6–8 pieces, shape into rings.  Oil rings lightly.  Let rest 10 min.

Poach 2-3 min. each in boiling water, turning once; drain.

Bake 425°F for 20–25 min. Cool on rack.

Dissolve the honey in the melted butter, and mix in to make the dough; add remaining water as necessary.

Knead well, and rise 2 hours in a greased bowl.

Deflate, divide in half, and form loaves.  Makes 2 oval loaves or up to 8 good-sized baps.

Brush tops generously with olive oil.  If you make loaves, slash their tops to aid expansion.

Proof 50–60 minutes, then bake loaves 30–35 minutes at 400°F with steam.  If baking baps, increase the temperature to 425°F and reduce the time to 25 minutes.

### Soft Sandwich Bread

Dissolve yeast in 1 1/2 c. hot water.  Mix flour and salt, and sponge 25 minutes.

Dissolve honey in remaining hot water, and mix well into suspension with olive oil.

Make dough, adding all the remaining liquid, and additional water as needed.

Knead smooth, and rise 90 minutes in a covered, greased bowl.  Deflate, cut, and shape into balls.

Let rest 10 minutes, then form loaves.

Proof 40–50 minutes covered.  Bake at 400°F for 35–40 minutes with no steam.

Brush loaves with a corn starch glaze about ten minutes before removing from oven, and repeat once out.

Makes two full-sized loaves.  The recipe can be halved, if necessary.

### Dinner Rolls

- 2 1/2 t.	yeast
- 4 c.		flour
- 2 t.		salt
- 4 T.		melted butter (for dough)
- 1 c.		milk
- 2 T.		sugar
- 2		eggs (beaten)
- 2 T.		melted butter (for glaze)

Dissolve yeast in 1/2 c. of milk.

Warm remaining milk with butter and sugar until butter is melted, then let stand to cool, and beat in the eggs.

Sponge yeast mixture briefly, then form dough, and knead smooth.

Add extra flour if needed, but be ware that the dough should be soft, but not dry.

Rise 1.5 hours, deflate, and rest 10 minutes.

Divide dough in half, and roll each piece out to approx. 8" x 16", and cut lengthwise into 4 strips each.  Cut each strip into rectangles, brush all with butter, then fold in half.

Proof 30 minutes on a buttered baking sheet, placing rolls beside each other so that they bake together.  Brush tops with melted butter just before baking.  Bake 15–20 min. hot (425°F), then cool on a rack.

Rolls may be shaped in a variety of ways:  Twists, bows, and snails are particularly easy.  For a “cloverleaf” shape, roll each piece into three small balls, put them together in a tight-packing configuration, and let them proof in a muffin pan.

Notes:
- Warm the milk before dissolving the yeast.

### Tasty Brown Bread

- 7 c.	flour
- 1 T.	salt
- 2 T.	oat bran (optional)
- 4 t.	yeast
- 1/4 c. oil (canola oil)
- 1/8 c. molasses
- 2 3/4 c. hot water

Dissolve yeast in 1 c. hot water; sponge in dry mixture 22 min.

Fill water to 1 c., raise with oil to 1.25 c. mark, then raise to the next 1/8 c. mark with molasses, and top up with water to 1 3/4 c.

Stir thoroughly and use this dark brew when making the dough.  The result should be quite soft and pliant.  Knead

as usual, rise 90 min., let rest 10 min., loaf and proof 50 min.; bake 40 min. at 400°F.  Makes 2 standard loaves.
