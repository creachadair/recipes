*Synopsis:* Quick pickled vegetables.

Quick pickles are sometimes called "refrigerator" pickles.  They are not
suitable for long-term storage, but will keep well for a few weeks if stored
refrigerated after preparation.

## Tools

-  Sealable jars for storage.
-  Saucepan for preparing brine.

## Ingredients

-  Equal parts vinegar and water.
-  1 tbsp. (kosher) salt or 2 tsp. pickling salt per 1 c. water.
-  1 tsp. granulated sugar per 1 c. water (optional).
-  Vegetables for pickling, 1 pint per 1 c. water.
-  Herbs and spices to taste: 1 to 3 tsp. per 1 c. water.

## Preparation

### Vegetables

-  Wash and cut vegetables into thin slices or strips.
-  Place vegetables and spices into the jars, uncovered.

### Brine

The amount of brine should be sufficient to fill the containers that will be
used to store the results. Divide the total capacity of all the containers to
be filled by two to get a rough volume of vinegar and water. The vegetables
will take up some of the volume, but it is better to have too much brine than
not enough.

-  Bring water and vinegar to a boil.
-  Dissolve salt (and sugar) into the liquid.

## Assembly

-  Remove brine from heat.
-  Pour brine into containers to cover vegetables.
-  Loosely cover containers, and tap out air bubbles.
-  Firmly seal jars, let cool.

After jars are sealed, they should be refrigerated for storage.

## Notes

*  Either white or cider vinegar is suitable for pickling. Avoid balsamic or
   other aged or concentrated vinegars.
   
*  Good spice ideas: Mustard seed, black peppercorns, coriander, turmeric,
   paprika, pepper flakes.

*  Good herb ideas: Dill, thyme, oregano, marjoram, rosemary.
   
*  A trick for measuring liquid volume: Cut up the vegetables and fill the
   dry containers, but do not add herbs or spices. Fill with water, then
   drain that water into a measuring cup. Pour off half the measured volume
   and top up with vinegar.
