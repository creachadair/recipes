# Tempora Batter

*Synopsis:* A light surface batter for frying.

Tempura was introduced into Japan by Spanish and Portuguese missionaries in the
late 16th Century.

## Ingredients

-  1 egg
-  1 c. ice water
-  1 c. white flour

## Preparation

-  Lightly beat the egg.
-  Add the water and mix lightly.
-  Add flour and mix coarsely. Do not beat smooth; the result should be lumpy.

## Assembly & Baking

-  Dredge materials to fry in the batter and drop in hot oil.
-  Skim oil between batches to keep it clean, so food does not absorb too much oil.

Frying temperatures:

 - For vegetables: 340째 F
 - For fish: 360째 F

## Notes

*  Do not prepare batter far in advance of use. It does not keep well, and may
   become sodden.

*  To test temperature, drop a bit of batter into the oil: If it sinks halfway
   before rising, it is about 340째 F. If it stays immediately on the surface
   it is about 360째 F (too hot for vegetables).

*  Some recipes add sake (0.8 oz. for 1 c. water), clam broth (2.5 oz.).

*  Some recipes add sugar and/or soy sauce for flavour.
