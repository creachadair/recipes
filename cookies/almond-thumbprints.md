## Ingredients

-  1 c. sweet butter
-  2/3 c. white sugar
-  1/2 tsp. salt
-  1 tsp. vanilla extract

-  2 eggs, separated, reserve whites
-  2 c. all-purpose white flour
-  2 c. finely-chopped blanched almonds
-  Seedless fruit jam (e.g., raspberry)


## Preparation

Prepare the dough at least 3-4 hours in advance of assembly.

1.  Cream butter in a large mixing bowl.
2.  Fold in sugar, salt, vanilla extract, and egg yolks, and beat until fluffy.
3.  Add in flour and mix until well-incorporated.
4.  Shape dough into a large ball, wrap in wax paper or plastic and chill well.


## Assembly & Baking

1.  Preheat oven to 300Â°F.
2.  Slightly beat the reserved egg whites.
3.  Divide dough into 3 equal pieces.
4.  On a lightly-floured board, roll each piece into a 1 in. diameter tube shape.
5.  Cut tubes into 3/4 in. discs, and shape each disc into a ball.
6.  Dip each ball into egg white and roll in chopped almonds.
7.  Place each ball on an ungreased cookie sheet and press with a thumb to make
    an indentation suitable to hold fruit or jam.
8.  Fill each indentation with jam (but see Note 1).
9.  Bake 15-20 minutes, then cool on a wire rack.


## Notes

1.  Some people prefer to add the jam after baking. Either is fine.

2.  Cookies can be stored in a tighly-sealed container, or frozen.
