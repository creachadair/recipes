## Ingredients

-  2 eggs (see below)

### Dough

-  1 c. sweet (unsalted) butter (2 sticks)
-  2/3 c. white sugar
-  1/2 tsp. salt
-  1 tsp. vanilla extract
-  2 egg yolks
-  2 c. all-purpose white flour

### Decoration

-  2 c. blanched almonds
-  seedless raspberry jam
-  whites of 2 eggs


## Preparation

-  Separate the egg yolks from the whites; reserve the whites.

### Dough

Several hours before baking, or overnight:

-  Cream butter with sugar, salt, and vanilla.
-  Add egg **yolks** and beat until light and fluffy.
-  Combine flour until well-blended.
-  Shape dough into a ball.
-  Chill dough thoroughly, wrapped (waxed paper) or covered.

### Decoration

-  Lightly beat the reserved egg **whites**.
-  Finely chop the blanched almonds.


## Assembly & Baking

-  Divide dough into 3 equal pieces.
-  On a lightly-floured board, shape dough into 1 inch diameter tubes.
-  Cut tubes into 3/4 inch pieces, and shape them into balls.
-  Dip each ball in the egg white, and roll in almonds.
-  Place each ball on a cookie sheet and press with a finger to make an
   indentation (the "thumbprint"). Leave about 2 inches space between cookies.
-  Fill indentations with raspberry jam (~1/4 tsp. each).
-  Bake at 300°F for 15−20 minutes.
-  Remove to cooling rack.


## Notes

*  You can add the jam either before or after baking.
*  Apricot jam also works well.
