## Assembly & Baking

## Notes

*  In our current oven as of Dec 2020, bake for 11 minutes.

*  If you prefer chewy cookies, err toward less baking time.

*  Treat ginger as a limiting reagent and decide how many batches to make based
   on that. Chop it up and see how much you have.

*  To obtain a vegan recipe, replace egg with 1/4 c. applesauce and use vegan
   margarine in place of butter.
