## Ingredients

### Wet

-  6 tbsp. butter or margarine
-  3/4 c. white sugar
-  1/2 c. crystallized ginger (85–90 g.)
-  1/4 c. molasses
-  1 large egg

### Dry

-  2 c.	flour
-  2 tsp. baking soda
-  3/4 tsp.	ground cinnamon
-  1/2 tsp. ground nutmeg


## Preparation

-  Chop ginger and macerate in 1/3 c. of the sugar.
-  Cream together butter and 1/3 c. of the sugar, and beat until fluffy.
-  Fold ginger, molasses, and egg, and mix well.
-  In a separate bowl, mix flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and nutmeg.
-  Fold dry ingredients gradually into the wet base.
-  Cover dough and chill for at least 1 hour.


## Assembly & Baking

-  Shape dough into spherical balls.
-  Roll each ball in white sugar (use the remaining sugar).
-  Place sugared spheres 2–3 inches apart on a greased baking sheet.
-  Bake at 350°F for 10–12 minutes.


## Notes

*  Treat ginger as a limiting reagent and decide how many batches to make based
   on that. Chop it up and see how much you have.

*  To obtain a vegan recipe, replace egg with 1/4 c. applesauce and use vegan
   margarine in place of butter.

*  If you prefer chewy cookies, err toward less baking time.

*  The 3/4 c. of sugar is the total for the recipe, 1/3 c. for macerating, 1/3
   c. for dough, and 1/12 c. for rolling.  The amount "left over" for rolling
   is experiential, not precise.
