# Boiled Eggs

1. Prepare a pot with water and a steaming basket, as for cooking vegetables.
2. Cover and bring to a boil.
3. Add eggs to steamer basket and cover.
4. Reduce heat to medium and steam (see below).
5. Remove from heat and transfer eggs to a dish of ice water to cool.

Cool eggs immediately so that sulfur collected on the surface of the yolk will
migrate back away, avoiding the dark "stain" that may otherwise occur.

## Cooking Time

- Jammy (for ramen): 10 minutes
- Soft boiled: 11 minutes
- Firm boiled: 12 minutes
- Full cooked: 12.5 minutes

It is not necessary to add salt or vinegar to the water as you would do for curing when boiling in the water directly.
