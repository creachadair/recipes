<!-- TODO: ![image](../img/recipe-title.jpg) -->

*Synopsis:* A cold salad of grated raw carrots with lemon, toasted mustard
seeds, and salt.

## Ingredients

-  5 carrots, peeled
-  1/4 tsp. salt
-  2 tbsp. vegetable oil
-  1 tbsp. whole black mustard seeds
-  2 tsp. lemon juice


## Preparation

-  Coarsely grate or julienne carrots.
-  Mix grated carrots and salt, let stand 10 min.
-  Heat oil over medium heat until very hot.
-  Add mustard seeds to oil, shake to mix.
-  Cook a few minutes until the seeds begin to pop and lighten in colour, then
   remove from heat.


## Assembly

-  Pour the oil/seed mixture over the carrots.
-  Add lemon juice, and toss.
-  Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.


## Notes

*  I like to soak a couple tablespoons of raisins in hot water for 2-3 hours,
   and then toss them in also.
