## Notes

*  Asparagus and broccoli are also good with this recipe.

   For broccoli or other "thicker" greens I recommend microwave-steaming the
   pieces for 3 minutes with water in a covered dish, prior to adding them to
   the pan. Drain the steam water before adding them to the pan.

*  I also like to add thin-sliced portobello mushrooms along with the vegetable

*  I often split the 1.5 tsp. of turmeric into 0.5 tsp. each of turmeric,
   cumin, and chili powder, or other spices (ginger, coriander, paprika).
   The turmeric is key to the flavour, so keep at least 0.5 tsp. of that.
