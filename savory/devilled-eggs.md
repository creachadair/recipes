<!-- TODO: ![image](../img/devilled-eggs.jpg) -->

*Synopsis:* Hard-boiled egg whites stuffed with dressed yolks and mild spices.

## Ingredients

-  8 eggs, [hard boiled](../basics/hardboiled-eggs.md)
-  8 tbsp. mayonnaise
-  1/2 tsp. ground horseradish
-  1/8 tsp. ground black pepper
-  1/4 tsp. salt
-  3/4 tsp. ground yellow mustard
-  1/4 tsp. dried parsley leaves
-  2 tbsp. onion, finely minced
-  paprika to garnish


## Preparation

[Boil eggs](../basics/hardboiled-eggs.md) to a firm or fully cooked yolk stage.

### Filling

1.  Shell eggs, and cut each into half lengthwise.
2.  Remove yolks and collect in a bowl; let whites stand on a dry surface.
3.  Combine mayonnaise, horseradish, black pepper, salt, mustard, and parsley,
    and mix thoroughly into the yolks until a smooth consistency is achieved.
4.  Mix in minced onion.

## Assembly

-  Spoon ~1 tsp. of filling into each egg white half, and fluff lightly.
-  Garnish lightly with paprika.


## Notes

*  Add a small amount of ground cayenne pepper for more bite, but do not add
   too much or it will overpower the other flavours.

*  Be careful not to over-salt, as too much salt makes the filling taste harsh.

*  When making larger quantities, it is more efficient to use a pastry bag to
   fill the egg whites.
