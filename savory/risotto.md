# Risotto

*Synopsis:* A thick broth congealed in rice starch.

Risotto is essentially the same concept as congee, but with a different set of
flavour profiles.

## Ingredients

-  100g short-grain rice
-  600mL water or broth
-  2-3 T finely-minced sweet onion
-  2 T olive oil
-  [optional] other ingredients to taste
-  [optional] other spices

## Preparation

-  Heat olive oil in a sauce pan till very hot.
-  Toast onions and spices in oil until brown on the edges.
-  Add rice to oil and cook 1-2 minutes.
-  Add broth and other ingredients.
-  Reduce heat to very low and cover.
-  Let simmer 40 minutes, stirring every 4-5 minutes.

The final texture should be thick and cling well to a spoon.

## Notes

I typically use vegetable broth, made either fresh or using a bouillon cube.

Traditionally risotto would be made with some quantity of good dry white wine,
though that is not necessary. I sometimes cut a bit of soy cause (1 tsp.)  in
with the broth for stronger additives.

*  Other ingredients:
   - Portobello mushroom, chopped small.
   - 1/3 of a sweet potato, cooked, hulled, and minced.
   - 2-3 minced Brussels sprouts.
   - Soy sausage, cut into small bits.

*  Spice suggestions (choose appropriate subsets):
   - Chili powder or toasted chili oil.
   - Cayenne pepper.
   - Powdered turmeric.
   - Rosemary leaves.

*  Additives for broth:
   - 1 tsp soy sauce.
   - With sweet potato: 1 T maple syrup.

*  Optionally finish with a small block of smoked Gouda or parmesan, shredded.
   Add this near the end of cooking.
