## Ingredients

### Meat & Spices

-  2 to 4 lb. beef or lamb, cut into small cubes.
-  1 1/2 tbsp. ground paprika.
-  1 tsp. ground cumin.
-  1/4 tsp. ground black pepper.
-  1 tsp. ground turmeric (optional).
-  1/4 tsp. ground cayenne pepper (optional).

### Vegetables

-  2-3 large sweet onions, peeled and chopped.
-  2 cloves garlic, finely minced.

-  2 large carrots, peeled and diced.
-  1-2 sticks celery, diced.
-  5-6 white or crimini mushrooms, chopped.
-  1/2 c. pearled barley.
-  2-3 medium red potatoes, washed and cubed.
-  1/2 bell pepper, diced (optional).
-  1/2 c. whole-kernel corn (optional).

### Broth

-  2 c. water.
-  4-5 tbsp. vegetable oil.
-  1 tsp. salt.

### Roux

-  1/2 c. water.
-  2 tsp. vegetable oil.
-  3 tbsp. flour.

## Preparation

These instructions are for preparation in a large pressure-cooker.  A
slow-cooker will also work, but will require longer cooking times.

### Meat & Spices

-  Combine meat, paprika, cumin, black pepper, turmeric, and cayenne pepper in
   a bowl, and mix well with hands or a wooden spoon so that the spices coat
   the meat.

### Base

Prepare in a 3-5 gallon pressure cooker or crock pot.

-  Heat vegetable oil over medium-high heat in the empty pot until sizzling.
-  Add onions and garlic and cook stirring until translucent.
-  Add the meat and spices, and stir well until lightly browned.
-  Add 2 c. water until the meat is just covered.
-  Pour in the barley.

Seal the cooker and allow it to come up to pressure. Once it is stable and
venting, allow to cook for 15 min.

### Vegetables

Once the base has cooked for 15 min. at pressure: 

-  Remove the pot from heat.
-  Use cold water to cool the pot till the pressure lock dissipates.
-  Remove the lid.
-  Add the remaining vegetables and the salt, and stir in.  If necessary, you
   may wish to add more water to ensure the mixure remains covered.

Re-seal the cooker, return it to heat, and allow it to come up to pressure a
second time. Once it is stable and venting, allow to cook for 5 min.

### Roux

-  Combine 1/2 c. water and 2 tsp. vegetable oil in a small cup or dish.
-  Add flour and stir or whisk vigorously until fully combined.

## Assembly and Serving

-  Remove the pot from heat.
-  Use cold water to cool the pot till the pressure lock dissipates.
-  Remove the lid.
-  Let stand 5 min. till the bubbling subsides.
-  Pour in the roux little by little, stirring well.
-  Let stand 5 min. more.

Serves 3-5 people.
