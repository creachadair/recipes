## Ingredients

-  1 potato, peeled and diced
-  1 medium to large onion, diced
-  1 small green pepper (or equivalent volume of chilis), chopped
-  4 tbsp. butter
-  4 tbsp. flour
-  2 c. corn (more as desired)
-  1 qt. whole milk
-  1 1/2 tsp. salt
-  1/2 tsp. black pepper

### Optional Additions

These are additional ingredients I sometimes add. You probably do not want to
add all of them to the same batch; choose judiciously.

-  1 bay (laurel) leaf
-  1/4 to 1/2 hot serrano pepper, de-seeded and minced
-  2-3 small carrots, peeled and finely julienned
-  1 stalk celery, minced
-  Fresh thyme leaves
-  Cilantro leaves or ground coriander (seeds)
-  Dash of turmeric for colour and gentle flavour


## Preparation

-  Sauté potato, onion, and peppers in butter until soft and translucent
-  Add flour and mix well to make a roux.
-  Add corn, milk, and seasonings, and stir well.
-  Bring to a near-boil, but do not permit it to boil.
-  Reduce heat and simmer 20–30 minutes or until vegetables are tender.

If desired, you may puree the results with an immersion blender or food
processor to achieve a finer consistency.


## Notes

*  Serves 2–3.

*  It is important to cook the peppers before adding the liquid.  Their final
   texture should be soft, not crisp, and since the liquid will not be boiled
   pre-cooking ensures this.

*  I sometimes substitute bacon fat for butter: Cook the bacon in the pot where
   you intend to sauté the vegetables first, then remove and chop the bacon
   while the vegetables are cooking.
   
   Add the resulting bacon bits back to the soup late in the cooking process,
   or serve them as a garnish.
