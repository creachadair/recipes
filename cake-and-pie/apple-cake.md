## Ingredients

### Filling

- 4 or 5 good-sized apples.
- juice of 1 lemon, 1-2 tbsp.
- 1 tsp. cinnamon.
- 2 tbsp. white sugar.
- (optional) 1/4 c. finely-chopped walnuts.

### Dough

- 1 1/2 c. flour (192g)
- 1/2 tsp. baking powder
- 1/3 c. sugar (70g)
- 1 egg
- 1 stick butter
- dash of salt

### Topping

-  1/2 c. flour (64g)
-  1/4 c. sugar (53g)
-  1/4 c. butter or margarine


## Preparation

You may prepare the components in any order, but I recommend starting with the
filling so that it has time to stand.

### Filling

-  Cut apples into small chunks in a bowl.
-  Combine cinnamon and sugar.
-  Add lemon juice and cinnamon-sugar mix to apples.
-  Stir gently to combine; cover, and set aside.

### Dough

-  Mix together all ingredients with hands to make a flexible dough.

-  Form into a ball and roll out flat, around .5 cm (1/4 in.) thick.

-  Press into either a 9 in. round cake pan or round baking dish to form a
   shell. Be sure the dough covers the bottom and sides completely.

### Topping

-  Work ingredients together with your hands until it all sticks together.
-  If it is necessary to let the topping stand, cover and refrigerate.


## Assembly & Baking

-  Prepare dough, filling, and topping as described.
-  [optional] Brush the inside of the crust with melted butter.
-  Pour the apple mixture into the shell.
-  Crumble the topping over the top of the apple mixture.
-  Bake at 325Â°F for 45 minutes or until apples are tender and topping golden.


## Notes

*  Do not let the butter soften too much in advance; it is easier to work and
   develops a better texture if it is still fairly cold.

*  For a crisper, sweeter crust, add 1 tbsp. extra sugar.
