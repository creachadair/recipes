# Family Recipes and Other Interesting Food

This repository contains various food recipes (from family and otherwise),
along with documentation related to food preparation that I found interesting.

## Weights & Measures

Since I and most of my family live in the U.S., most or all of these recipes
are given in English units. To the extent possible I have tried to normalize
the notation for these units, since there is some variation.

One of the peculiarities of English recipes, is that they often use liquid
meaures (teaspoons, tablespoons) for small amounts of dry ingredients such as
salt, spices, baking powder, and baking soda. The correct way to measure dry
ingredients is of course by mass -- and professional cooks even in the U.S. do
so.  Family recipes, however, are rarely written that way -- and in fact many
home kitchens do not maintain a suitable mass balance. Many of the recipes you
find in English on the Internet are aimed at home cooks, and so share this
peculiarity.

Someday I would like to convert all the dry volume measures in my recipes to
mass, but that task has so far eluded my patience. If you have a notion to give
that treatment to one of the recipes here, feel free to send me a pull request.

Here are the basic liquid measure notations. Note that culinary teaspoons are
ordinarly sold in sets with 1/8, 1/4, 1/2, and 1 teaspoon measures.

| Rep   | Name       | Equivalent | Metric (approx) |
|-------|------------|------------|-----------------|
| tsp.  | teaspoon   |            | 5mL             |
| tbsp. | tablespoon | 3 tsp.     | 15mL            |
| c.    | cup        | 16 tbsp.   | 240mL           |
| pt.   | pint       | 2 c.       | 470mL           |
| qt.   | quart      | 2 pt.      | 950mL           |
| gal.  | gallon     | 4 qt.      | 3780mL          |

Recipes usually use those sizes (or combinations of them). Convert accordingly:
If a recipe calls for 1 1/2 tbsp. of sugar, use 1 tsbp. + 1 tsp. + 1/2 tsp.
Or, as most home cooks do, just eyeball it.

Ordinarily when a recipe calls for, say, 1/2 tsp., it means a "level"
half-teaspoon, viz., the material should be scraped off level with the top of
the measure (not packed down), as so:


```
==========\********/
           \******/
```

Sometimes, however, a recipe will call for a "heaping" measure. This means the
material should not be levelled in the spoon but should be allowed to pile up
toward its angle of repose, e.g.,

```
              **
            ******
==========\********/
           \******/
```

To those who may be offended or aggrieved by the imprecision of this, I can
only offer my sympathies.

### Concerning Fruits & Nuts

Some recipes will call for measured amounts of aggregates, e.g., "1 c. chopped
walnuts" or "1/4 c. dried cranberries" or similar.  This usually means you fill
the appropriate measure with the substance in question. Again, mass would be a
better solution, but that's often not what people do.
